title: "The Making of Technology in Shenzhen, Local and Global Implications"
description: "
<p>
Electronic devices possess their own trajectory. The production of digital technologies, from raw materials to information machines, take place in various places and cycles around the planet. On their back, the “Made in China” tag stands as a crucial piece of a mostly unwritten story.
<br />
During the last decades, the region of the Pearl River Delta in Southern China has been home to the largest production and assembling of technologies that has ever taken place in the history of mankind. At its forefront, the city of Shenzhen has become a new global center for technology, with many of the biggest tech companies in the world today.
<br />
The legendary speed of Shenzhen’s urban and industrial development has led to the appearance of entirely new technological phenomena with all their drawbacks, from the confidential development of weird *shanzhai* phones to the biggest shipment of Foxconn products all over the world. This discussion panel will be an occasion to look back at the many sides of this critical zone.
